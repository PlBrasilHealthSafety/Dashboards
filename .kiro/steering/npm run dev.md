# Npm Run Dev Command

## Important Rule
- NEVER run the `npm run dev` command in the terminal
- Instead, prompt the user via text to run the command manually
- The user must run `npm run dev` in their own terminal to start the development server

## Reason
The `npm run dev` command starts a development server that runs continuously, which is not suitable for automatic execution by the agent.
